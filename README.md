# kwak-react
A simple means of creating a new React project, without all the fancy blackboxing of create-react-app or other boilerplate methods.
That means this is a lot more basic! You'll find many of the common modules you'll need, plus some testing modules. 

## Starting
Run commands
1. npm install
2. npm run react-dev
3. npm start

Code away!
